# CS50
Part of [OSSU's Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum (01/2018)

This repository has my notes and problem sets on Harvard's CS50 course,  available for free on edX.

Just to challenge myself a little more, I'll write the notes in my yet no so good english.

By January of 2018, the course was available at this [link](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).
