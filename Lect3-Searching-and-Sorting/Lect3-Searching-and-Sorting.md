# Lecture3 -> Searching and Sorting

## Searching
* Linear search (read each one until find)
* Binary search (in a sorted array, divide the problem until find)

## Sorting
* [Insertion sort](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/insertion-sort/a/insertion-sort)
* [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* [Selection sort](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/a/selection-sort-pseudocode)
* [Merge sort](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/merge-sort/a/overview-of-merge-sort)

## Asymptotic notation
* Big O (the worst case scenario)
* Big Omega (Ω) (the best case scenario)
* Theta (Θ) (if both the Omega and O are equal)
* To simplify, we generally only look the term with the biggest magnitude to define its running time. For example, *(n²-n)/2* becomes *O(n²)*
