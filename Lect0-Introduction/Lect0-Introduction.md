# Lecture0 -> Introduction

## Binary
* A little bit about the binary system, 0s and 1s, machine code, powers of 2 instead of 10, the electricity involved (transistors). 
* ASCII table for characters, RGB for colors.

## Algorithms
* Algorithms are instructions on how to solve a problem. **Computational thinking** is the idea of having these precise instructions.
* Pseudocode.

## Scratch
* Introducing MIT's Scratch.

This repository has my notes and problem sets on Harvard's CS50 course,  available for free on edX.
